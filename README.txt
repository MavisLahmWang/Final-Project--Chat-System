This is the Final Chat System made by Jiaxin Bu and Xinran Wang.

WARNING: Please download all files in one directory (e.g.: "work_directory"), and change the current directory to this directory (i.e., "work_directory"). Then run the chat system files. Otherwise, the pygame may not work.

File introductions:

1. The PyGame-related files
bullettt.png, enemy.png, spacecraft.png: basic images for the PyGame display;
AirBattle.py: the main python file for running the game;
client_state_machine: if user types in "game", the PyGame will start on the screen.

Information referred to when developing the PyGame: https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/ (This is a basic introduction to PyGame); https://www.cnblogs.com/SRL-Southern/p/4942607.html (This code teaches how to create the classes of Bullets and Enemies).
By the way, we didn't use the sprite module built in pygame (even if it is cooler), we basically used the OOP method to draw the bullets and enemies continually on the screen.
